## IPv6 Proxy Server [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Create your own IPv6 backconnect proxy server with just one script on any Linux distribution.
This code is an adaptation of the original project.
the original design works with an entire block of IPv6 attached to the server.
This fork works with a fixed list of IPs previously attached to the server.


### Tutorial

Assuming you already have several IPv6 attached to your server.

Just run:

```bash
#sudo su
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samuelrac/ipv6-multiple-proxy-server/master/ipv6-proxy-server.sh && chmod +x ipv6-proxy-server.sh
./ipv6-proxy-server.sh -u user -p pass --start-port 30000
```

Uncomment first line or run all commands with `sudo` if you`re not under root.



If script already installed, you can just run one command to reconfigure parameters, for example:

```bash
./ipv6-proxy-server.sh -u user2 -p pass2 -t http --start-port 30000
```

Old instance will be disabled and new starts without reinstallation very quickly.


#### If you want to start proxy server when reboot, add this cron routine to crontab file `/etc/crontab`
```bash
@reboot /usr/bin/bash /root/proxyserver/proxy-startup.sh
```
**change the script path to the right path according to your user**



#### If you want to uninstall proxy server, just run:

```bash
./ipv6-proxy-server.sh --uninstall
```

Proxy server will stopped, all configuration files, firewalls, shedulers and so on will be reset to initial state.


**Command line arguments:**

- `-t` or `--proxies-type` - Proxies type - `http` or `socks5`. Default `socks5`, if no value provided
- `-u` or `--username` - All proxies auth login
- `-p` or `--password` - All proxies auth password (if you specify neither username not password, proxy will run without authentication)
- `--random` - bool parameter without value, if used, each backconnect proxy will have random username and password, that will be written in backconnect proxies file (`-f` argument)
- `--start-port` - backconnect IPv4 start port. If you create 1500 proxies and `start-port` is `20000`, and server external IPv4 is, e.g,`180.113.14.28` you can connect to proxies using `180.113.14.28:20000`, `180.113.14.28:20001` and so on until `180.113.14.28:21500`
- `--allowed-hosts` - list of allowed hosts, to which user can connect via proxy (comma-separated, without spaces, for example - `"google.com,*.google.com,fb.com"`). All other hosts will be denied, if this parameter is provided
- `--denied-hosts` - list of denied hosts (comma-separated, without spaces, for example - `"google.com,*.google.com,fb.com"`). All others hosts will be allowed, if this parameter is provided
- `-l` or `--localhost` - bool parameter without value, if used, all backconnect proxy will be available only on localhost (`127.0.0.1:30000` instead of `180.113.14.28:30000`)
- `-b` or `--backconnect-ip` - server IPv4 backconnect address for proxies, use ONLY if script cannot parse IP correctly and your server has non-standard IP configuration
- `-f` or `--backconnect-proxies-file` - path to file, in which backconnect proxies list will be written when proxies start working (default `~/proxyserver/backconnect_proxies.list`). You can just copy all proxies from this file and use them in your soft as list of IPv6 proxies.
- `-i` or `--interface` - ethernet interface name, to which IPv6 subnet is allocated and where all proxies will be raised. Automatically parsed from system info by default, use ONLY if you have non-standard/additional interfaces on your server.
- `--uninstall` - uninstall proxy server, you don't need to provide any other parameters with it.
- `--info` - get info about running proxy server (proxy count, rotating, auth, etc.)
